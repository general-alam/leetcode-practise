# LeetCode Practice  

A collection of LeetCode problems Iâ€™ve solved and reviewed.  

## Goals  
- Strengthen Python fundamentals: practice data structures and algorithmic techniques  
- Write efficient solutions with time & space complexity in mind  
- Develop better problem-solving intuition through regular practice

## Notes  
- Each solution includes brief explanation and complexity analysis  
- Repository synced with [LeetHub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub)
